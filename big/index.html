        <p>
          Ethiopia is considered to be the birthplace of the coffee plant and of
          coffee culture. It is thought that coffee was discovered in Ethiopia
          as long ago as the ninth century. Today, over 12 million people in
          Ethiopia are involved in the cultivation and picking of coffee, and
          coffee remains a central part of Ethiopian culture.

          One common Ethiopian coffee saying is "Buna dabo naw". This literally
          translates to "Coffee is our bread". It demonstrates the central role
          that coffee plays in terms of diet and illustrates the level of
          importance placed on it as a source of sustenance

        <h2>The Ethiopian Coffee Legend</h2>
        <p>
          The most popular legend of coffee in Ethiopia usually goes something
          like this: Kaldi, an Abyssinian goat herder from Kaffa, was herding
          his goats through a highland area near a monastery. He noticed that
          they were behaving very strangely that day, and had begun to jump
          around in an excited manner, bleating loudly and practically dancing
          on their hind legs.

        <p>
          He found that the source of the excitement was a small shrub (or, in
          some legends, a small cluster of shrubs) with bright red berries.
          Curiosity took hold and he tried the berries for himself.

        <h3>Ethiopina Coffee Ceremony</h3>
        <p>
          Ethiopia's coffee ceremony is an integral part of their social and
          cultural life. An invitation to attend a coffee ceremony is considered
          a mark of friendship or respect and is an excellent example of
          Ethiopian hospitality. Performing the ceremony is almost obligatory in
          the presence of a visitor, whatever the time of day. Don't be in a
          hurry though - this special ceremony can take a few hours. So sit back
          and enjoy because it is most definitely not instant.
